          <button type="button" class="collapsible">Abstract</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Investment in human capital and skill formation are a crucial feature of any effective development strategy, but much remains unknown on the consequences of  policies designed to increase attainment and reduce inequality in access to higher education. We exploit a discontinuity in eligibility for subsidies for private higher education in Brazil to investigate the causal impact of financial aid on the human capital investment decisions of students in the lower end of the ability distribution. We show that these students increase their likelihood of enrolling and persisting in higher education in response to financial aid eligibility. Exploring how students react when they are given the chance to choose between public tuition-free institutions and subsidized access to private higher education, we show that students eligible for aid are less likely to enroll in public institutions, with no significant impact on program quality. Finally, we evaluate distributional consequences and show that the impact is stronger for students in the higher end of the income distribution of potential beneficiaries. </p>

          <button type="button" class="collapsible">Abstract</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>  We develop a structural discrete choice model of demand to investigate the determinants of major choice. In  Brazil, and in several other countries, tuition varies at the major level, with some majors being consistently more expensive than others across institutions. In our framework, in which tuition varies at the major level, students can be credit constrained in their decision between different majors. We leverage our model and an expansion of a government-funded large scale student credit program in Brazil to evaluate how credit availability impacts major choice. We find that tuition and expected labor market returns are the main factors determining students' choice between different major. Using our estimated parameters to investigate the impact of credit availability on market composition, we show that the expansion of credit increases enrollment in private higher education as whole and has higher than average impact on majors considered high cost and high return, especially for lower income individuals --- which is consistent with our credit constraint at the major level model.   </p>

          <button type="button" class="collapsible">Abstract</button>
<div class="content">
  <p> Climate change is expected to have an impact on the reliability of urban water supply systems, with deep consequences for well-being and development. In this paper, we study the impact of water scarcity on the academic performance of students enrolled in basic education. We explore the consequences of a water rationing policy that affected a set of neighborhoods in Brazil's Federal District. Comparing the academic performance of students enrolled in schools located in neighborhoods affected by the rationing against the performance of students enrolled in non-affected neighborhoods, we find that water rationing has a negative and significant impact on students' performance in standardized math and language evaluations. We find that schools with good infrastructure can partially offset the negative impact of unreliable water supply systems on students’ performance, delineating a clear role for active public policy in building climate change resilience.
